This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in Express.js applications: the lack of proper error handling within route handlers, specifically when interacting with databases.  The `bug.js` file showcases a route handler that neglects to handle potential errors from a database query, which can lead to server crashes or unhelpful error messages.  The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected version with appropriate error handling.
